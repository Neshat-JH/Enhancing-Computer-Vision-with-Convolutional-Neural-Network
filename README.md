# Enhancing-Computer-Vision-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
The repository includes two notebooks! One includes creating a simple neural networks, and the second one covers implementation of convolutional layers!
The datasets (MNIST and fashion_mnist) are from the TensorFLow library.
Both projects are part of the Coursera "ntroduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning" course thought by Laurence Moroney!
