# Enhancing-Computer-Vision-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
The repository includes two notebooks! One includes creating a simple neural networks, and the second one covers implementation of convolutional layers! Both projects are part of the Coursera "ntroduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning" course thought by Laurence Moroney!
